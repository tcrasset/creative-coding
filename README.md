This is just a collection of creative coding projects that I've created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

Each small project will have it's own folder, while higher level functions will be in the [core](core/) folder.

## List of projects

- [Perlin noise color grid](perlin_grid/sketch.js)
- [Changing vector fields](vector_field/sketch.js)
- [Flow field with Perlin noise vector fields](flow_field/sketch.js)
